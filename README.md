### Additional Information

##### BeautifulSoup
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for getting data out of HTML, XML, and other markup languages. It helps you pull particular content from a webpage, remove the HTML markup, and save the information. The question is why we use this module in this project, although its data is taken from excel. The reason is that, the excel table taken from the USIS system is created in HTML format. You can see that this is not a regular text file when you want to read the file or open with notepad. Therefore, we have to import Beautiful Soup module for this project. 

##### Unicode: encoding="UTF-16"
Additionally, UTF-8 is used by about 95% of all web pages. In contrast, USIS system is in the very rare UTF-16 format. That's why we prefer UTF-16 for Unicode when reading with the open() function.
